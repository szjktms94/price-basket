# price basket app

### Setup
1, Check out the project from the given github link.

2, Import in intelliJ

3, run the /src/test/java/com.adthena.BillCreatorTest

4, If you want to run the app without test you can run
it from commandline using javac for compile, and java for run commands, and give the items as commandline arguments
or as I used the program I added the commandline arguments in IntelliJ next to the run button 'Edit configurations' -> 'Program arguments:'
